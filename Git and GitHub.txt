**Git**
	-Git is a popular version control system.

It is used for:

Tracking code changes
Tracking who made changes
Coding collaboration


Key Git Concepts

Repository: A folder where Git tracks your project and its history.
Clone: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
Commit: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
Branch: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
Push: Send your changes to a remote repository.

What is an Untracked File?

An untracked file is any file in your project folder that Git is not yet tracking.
These are files you've created or copied into the folder, but haven't told Git to watch.

What is a Tracked File?

A tracked file is a file that Git is watching for changes.
To make a file tracked, you need to add it to the staging area.

What is the Staging Area?

The staging area is like a waiting room for your changes.
You use it to tell Git exactly which files you want to include in your next commit.
This gives you control over what goes into your project history.

What is a Commit?

A commit is like a save point in your project.
It records a snapshot of your files at a certain time, with a message describing what changed.

**Write Multi-line Commit Messages**

**What is Tag?
-A tag in Git is like a label or bookmark for a specific commit.
 Tags are most often used to mark important points in your project history, like releases (v1.0 or v2.0).
 Tags are simple and reliable way to keep track of versions and share with your team or users.

Some common tag types include:

 Releases: Tags let you mark when your project is ready for release, so you (and others) can always find that exact version later.
 Milestones: Use tags to highlight major milestones, like when a big feature is finished or a bug is fixed.
 Deployment: Many deployment tools use tags to know which version of your code to deploy.
 Hotfixes: If you need to fix an old version, tags make it easy to check out and patch the right code.

 **Create an Annotated Tag (-a -m)
-An annotated tag stores your name, the date, and a message.
This is recommended for most uses.

git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"

**push tag* git push origin v1.0
**delete tag locally* - git tag -d v1.0
**delete tag from the remote repo** - git push origin --delete tag v1.0

**Update or Replace a Tag (Force Push)*

**What is Git Stash? Why Use It?

	-Sometimes you need to quickly switch tasks or fix a bug, but you're not ready to commit your work.
	-git stash lets you save your uncommitted changes and return to a clean working directory.
	-You can come back and restore your changes later.

Here are some common use cases:

Switch branches safely: Save your work before changing branches.
Handle emergencies: Stash your work to fix something urgent, then restore it.
Keep your work-in-progress safe: Avoid messy commits or losing changes.

Save your current changes (both staged and unstaged tracked files) with:

What gets stashed?

Tracked files (both staged and unstaged) are stashed by default.
Untracked files (new files not yet added to Git) are not stashed by default.
To stash untracked files too, use git stash -u (or --include-untracked).

...some points to be learn about stash...

**Git History**

-Git keeps a detailed record of every change made to your project.
 You can use history commands to see what changed, when, and who made the change.
 This is useful for tracking progress, finding bugs, and understanding your project's evolution.


Key Commands for Viewing History
	git log - Show full commit history - by pressing arrow key can view all commits and press q for exit.
	git log --oneline - Show a summary of commits
	git show <commit> - Show details of a specific commit
	git diff - See unstaged changes
	git diff --staged - See staged changes

Make frequent, meaningful commits to keep your history clear.
	Write clear commit messages so you and your team can understand changes later.
	Use git log --oneline for a quick overview of your commit history.
	Use git diff before committing to review your work.

**Git Help**

	-Git has many commands and options.
	-If you forget how a command works or want to learn about its options, you can use Git's built-in help.

Key Commands for Getting Help

 git help <command> - See the manual page for a command
 git <command> --help - See help for a command (same as above)
 git <command> -h - See a quick summary of options
 git help --all - List all possible Git commands
 git help -g - List guides and concepts


----------------------------------------------------------------------

**what is origin in Git?

-In Git, "origin" refers to the shorthand name for the primary remote repository from which your local repository was cloned. 
 It's essentially a convenient alias for the full URL of that remote repository, making it easier to refer to when performing operations 
 like pulling, pushing, or fetching.

-In Git, "origin" is a conventional name used to refer to the default remote repository where your code is stored. 
 It is not a reserved keyword but a naming convention that Git automatically assigns when you clone a repository. 
 Understanding "origin" helps in managing remote connections effectively.

**What is Remote Repository?

-A remote repository is a version of your project hosted on the internet. 
 GitHub is a popular platform for hosting remote repositories, enabling you to collaborate with others and back up your code.

**What is SSH?

-SSH (Secure Shell) is a way to connect securely to remote computers and services, like Git repositories.
 SSH uses a pair of keys (public and private) to make sure only you can access your code.

**How SSH Keys Work?

-SSH keys come in pairs: a public key (like a lock) and a private key (like your own key).
 You share the public key with the server (like GitHub or Bitbucket), but keep the private key safe on your computer.
 Only someone with the private key can access what's locked by the public key.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Git Fetch - git fetch downloads new data from a remote repository, but does not change your working files or branches. 
	      It lets you see what others have pushed before you merge or pull.

		--git fetch origin

**Git Merge - merge combines the current branch, with a specified branch.
	      We have confirmed that the updates are as expected, and we can merge our current branch (master) with origin/master:

**Git Pull - pull is a combination of fetch and merge.It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the
	     branch you are working on 

**Git Push - When we have made changes locally, we want to update our remote repository with the changes.
	     Transferring our local changes to our remote is done with a push command.	
		
		Several push commands are:

		1. Basic push - This command pushes your current branch to the remote repository named origin.
				This will upload your local commits to GitHub.
				You must have already committed your changes with git commit.

		2. Force push - If your push is rejected due to non-fast-forward updates (for example, after a rebase), 
				you can force the push.
				Warning: This can overwrite changes on the remote repository. Use with caution!
		3. 
=====================================

***If you want to clone only subdirectory of any repositiory         ---use sparse--- 
	with the help of sparse you can clone only directoy you want to work.

commands are:

	-git clone --no-checkout <repository-url>
	-cd <repository-directory>
	-git sparse-checkout init
	-git sparse-checkout set <folder name>
	-git chekout main



---------------------------------------------

Here are some commands to practice git pull, git fetch, and git merge:
1. Setting up
Create a new repository on your local machine:
Code

    mkdir git-practice
    cd git-practice
    git init
Create a sample file and commit it:
Code

    echo "Initial content" > sample.txt
    git add sample.txt
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a remote repository on GitHub or another platform and add it to your local repository:
Code

    git remote add origin <your-remote-repository-url>
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
2. git fetch
Simulate changes on the remote repository by editing the sample.txt file on GitHub or pushing new commits from another local repository.
Fetch the changes from the remote repository:
Code

    git fetch origin
This command downloads new commits, branches, and tags from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch. View the fetched changes.
Code

    git status
    git log --oneline --graph --all
You will see that the remote branch origin/main has moved ahead of your local main branch.
3. git merge
Merge the fetched changes into your local branch:
Code

    git merge origin/main
This command integrates the changes from the origin/main branch into your current branch (main).
If there are conflicts, resolve them manually in your text editor, then stage and commit the changes:
Code

    git add <conflicted-file>
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
Push the merged changes to the remote repository:
Code

    git push origin main
4. git pull 
Simulate changes on the remote repository again.
Pull the changes from the remote repository:
Code

    git pull origin main
This command fetches changes and merges them into your current branch in one step.
If there are conflicts, resolve them manually and commit the changes.
5. Other useful commands
To view all branches.
Code

    git branch -a
To see the difference between your local branch and the remote branch:
Code

    git diff main origin/main
This should provide a good foundation for practicing git pull, git fetch, and git merge. You can create more branches and experiment with different scenarios to improve your understanding.


-------------------------------------------------
**git fetch- just to check are there any changes available.
**git pull- downloading latest changes

=============

Sure! The `git reset` command is used to undo changes in your Git working directory and staging area. Here's a basic example to help you understand how it works:

---

### 🔧 **Example Scenario**

You have 3 commits in your Git history:

```
A - B - C (HEAD)
```

Now, suppose you want to reset your branch to commit `B`.

---

### ✅ **Command:**

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-id>
```

or using relative HEAD:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

This will:

* Move `HEAD` and branch pointer one commit back.
* Delete commit `C`.
* Remove changes of commit `C` from the working directory and staging area.

---

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
git log --oneline
# output:
# 3f8c1c3 (HEAD -> main) Added feature C
# a1b2c3d Added feature B
# 9e8a7f6 Initial commit

git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Now the latest commit is:

```
a1b2c3d Added feature B
```

---

### 🛠 Variants:

#### 1. **Soft Reset** (keeps changes in staging):

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

* Removes last commit but keeps changes in staging (`git add`).

#### 2. **Mixed Reset** (default, keeps changes in working dir but unstages them):

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

---

Let me know if you want a visual example or real-time practice steps!

--------------

Great! Let's do a real-time hands-on practice of `git reset` step by step. You can follow these steps in any local Git repo (or create a new one). We'll create 3 commits and then use `reset`.

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Practice:**

#### 🧱 **Step 1: Create a new Git repo**

```bash
mkdir reset-practice
cd reset-practice
git init
```

#### 📄 **Step 2: Create and commit file1**

```bash
echo "This is file1" > file1.txt
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Add file1"
```

#### 📄 **Step 3: Create and commit file2**

```bash
echo "This is file2" > file2.txt
git add file2.txt
git commit -m "Add file2"
```

#### 📄 **Step 4: Create and commit file3**

```bash
echo "This is file3" > file3.txt
git add file3.txt
git commit -m "Add file3"
```

#### 🔍 **Step 5: Check commit history**

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You will see something like:

```
d3c3c99 (HEAD -> main) Add file3
7b2c1c4 Add file2
a8e5f89 Add file1
```

---

### 🔄 **Step 6: Use `git reset`**

#### 🧹 Option 1: Hard Reset (removes commit & changes)

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Now check:

```bash
git log --oneline
ls
```

* `file3.txt` is gone
* Last commit is `Add file2`

---

#### 🔄 Option 2: Soft Reset (keeps changes in staging)

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Now check:

```bash
git status
```

* You’ll see `file3.txt` is still staged, but the commit is gone.

---

#### 🔄 Option 3: Mixed Reset (keeps changes in working dir but unstages them)

```bash
git reset HEAD~1
```

Now check:

```bash
git status
```

* `file3.txt` is modified but **unstaged**.

---

------------------------------------------GIT STASH----------------------

Bilkul bhai! `git stash` ek **temporary storage** jaisa hota hai — jab aapke working directory me kuch changes hote hain aur aap unhe commit nahi karna chahte, lekin branch switch karna hai ya kuch aur kaam karna hai, tab aap un changes ko stash me rakh sakte ho.

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Practice of `git stash`

Chalo step-by-step ek example karte hain.

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Naya repo banao ya kisi existing repo me jao**

```bash
mkdir stash-practice
cd stash-practice
git init
```

---

### 📄 **Step 2: File banao aur commit karo**

```bash
echo "Initial content" > notes.txt
git add notes.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### 🖊️ **Step 3: Kuch changes karo (but don't commit)**

```bash
echo "Temporary work in progress" >> notes.txt
```

Check current status:

```bash
git status
```

> Output me dikhega: `modified: notes.txt`

---

### 🧳 **Step 4: Stash the changes**

```bash
git stash
```

Ab check karo:

```bash
git status
```

> Output me bolega: `working tree clean`
> Matlab tumhare changes stash me chali gayi hain, aur file original form me aa gayi.

---

### 👀 **Step 5: Dekho stash list**

```bash
git stash list
```

> Output:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: <your last commit message>
```

---

### 🔄 **Step 6: Wapas changes apply karo**

```bash
git stash apply
```

> Ab `notes.txt` me phir se wahi changes aa gaye hain.

Ya agar tum stash hata ke apply karna chahte ho:

```bash
git stash pop
```

> Ye changes wapas karega aur stash list se hata dega.

---

### 🗑️ **(Optional) Stash delete karna**

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

Ya sabhi stash delete karne ke liye:

```bash
git stash clear
```

---

### 🔁 Recap of Useful `git stash` Commands:

| Command           | Use                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `git stash`       | Save current changes temporarily |
| `git stash list`  | Show all stashed changes         |
| `git stash apply` | Apply stash but keep in list     |
| `git stash pop`   | Apply stash and remove from list |
| `git stash drop`  | Delete a specific stash          |
| `git stash clear` | Clear all stashed changes        |

---

Agar chahe to mai tumhe ek **interactive quiz** ya aur advance stash example (multiple stashes, stash with name, stash specific files) bhi karwa sakta hoon. Batana!


---------------------

Tumne `git pull` command chalaya hai, aur ab **merge commit message screen (Vim editor)** open ho gaya hai. Ye tab hota hai jab local aur remote dono branches me alag commits hote hain, aur Git inhe **auto-merge** karta hai.

---

## ✅ **Ab kya karna hai (Exit from Vim after writing the merge commit)**

### 🖊️ Step 1: Agar message likhna chahte ho:

Tum yahan merge commit message likh sakte ho (ya as-it-is chhod sakte ho).

Jaise:

```text
Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
```

---

### ⌨️ Step 2: Vim se bahar kaise nikle (commit save karke)

#### Follow these keys:

1. **Press `Esc`** (to exit insert mode)
2. **Type `:wq`** (write and quit)
3. **Press `Enter`**

> `:wq` ka matlab hai "write (save) and quit"

---

### 📛 Agar cancel karna chahte ho (commit nahi karna):

1. Press `Esc`
2. Type `:q!` (force quit without saving)
3. Press `Enter`

---

### 🔁 Next Time Isko Avoid Karna Hai?

Agar tum bina merge message ke pull karna chahte ho, to use karo:

```bash
git pull --no-edit
```

---

Bhai agar tu chaahe to main tujhe `git pull`, `merge conflict`, aur `vim` editor ke shortcuts ka cheat sheet bhi de sakta hoon. Batao chahiye kya?

==========================================================================================================

Perfect bhai! Yahaan maine tumhare liye ek **Git Pull + Merge + Vim Editor Cheat Sheet** bana diya hai — short, simple aur real-world use ke liye 💡

---

## 🧲 **Git Pull + Merge Basics**

### 🔹 1. `git pull`

```bash
git pull
```

* Remote repository se latest changes laata hai.
* Agar dono branches me alag commits hote hain, to **merge** karta hai.

---

### 🔹 2. Auto Merge ke Time Vim Editor khul jaata hai

* Ye message likhne ko kehta hai: *"Why are you merging?"*
* Default message hota hai (change bhi kar sakte ho ya aise hi chhod sakte ho).

## ⚙️ **Vim Editor Commands** (bahar nikalne ke liye)

| Action                  | Command         | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 📝 **Insert mode**      | `i`             | Typing start karne ke liye                 |
| 🔚 **Stop typing**      | `Esc`           | Insert mode se normal mode me aane ke liye |
| 💾 **Save & Quit**      | `:wq` + `Enter` | Save & exit                                |
| ❌ **Quit without save** | `:q!` + `Enter` | Exit bina changes ke                       |
| 📖 **Only save**        | `:w` + `Enter`  | File save karo, par vim open rahe          |

---

## 🧰 **Useful Git Pull Options**

| Command                   | Use Case                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `git pull --no-edit`      | Merge message prompt ko skip karta hai    |
| `git pull --rebase`       | Rebase instead of merge (cleaner history) |
| `git fetch` + `git merge` | Pull ke steps manually karne ke liye      |

---

## 💥 Bonus: Merge Conflict Tips

Agar `git pull` karte waqt **conflict** aa gaya to:

1. Git mark kar dega conflict areas:

   ```text
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   your changes
   =======
   incoming changes
   >>>>>>> origin/main
   ```

2. Manually file edit karo, fir:

   ```bash
   git add conflicted-file.txt
   git commit
   ```

---

## 📌 Vim Editor Ko Default Se Hatana (Optional)

Agar tum Vim se pareshan ho, to Git ka editor VS Code set kar lo:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

Ab merge message VS Code me open hoga 🙌

---

Bhai agar tu chaahe to mai tujhe **Git practice task list** bhi de sakta hoon jaise stash, pull, merge conflict, branch, revert, reset — real-time kaam jaisa. Chahiye?
